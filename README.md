# TO DO LIST APP
BUILT BY USING - HTML , Bootstrap &amp; Javascript  

A to-do list app built with vanillaJS that handles entry, searching and deletion of tasks. The tasks are also stored locally in the browser so one can visit them later. The project highly depends on DOM manipulation methods. The design is original and built from scratch by me.
